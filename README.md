# grpo-genai-framework

The goal of this project is to re create the SWE-RL method.


It's basically collecting PR's from github api, and perform GRPO on it

it is inspired by this research paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18449

unfortunately there is so high limiting factor for me (compute cost)


it's only a fun project for me but I hope I can get more GPU's to try this out again
